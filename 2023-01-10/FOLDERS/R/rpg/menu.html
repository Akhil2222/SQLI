        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>There are 3 biomes, which are the <span style='color:forestgreen'>forest</span>,<span style='color:sandybrown'>desert</span>, and <span style='color:snow;background-color:black'>tundra</span>. The color of the text indicate the biomes. Each biome does something unique. The forest heals you twice as fast. The desert makes you go twice as fast, but it takes away half of your regeneration. The tundra makes you have half your speed, but you do double damage in the tundra. There are enemies trying to kill you. They have a red border around them, so it's pretty hard to miss them. Click them to deal damage. Your base damage, regeneration, and speed increase with every wave you beat.</p>
