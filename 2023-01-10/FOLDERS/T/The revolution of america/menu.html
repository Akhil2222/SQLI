    <h1>The Revolution of America</h1>
    <button><a href='main.html'>Play Game</a></button>
    <p>This is a game based off of the american revolution. The game has tweaked some parts of history(For example, the americans and the british were usually on one side, and there were french in The Seige of Yorktown.) </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Boston Massacre (1770)</b>: People were throwing rocks and snowballs at the british, so the british shot at the americans. 5 americans were killed</li>
        <li><b>The Boston Tea Party (1773)</b>: People were angry that Britain was forcing them to only drink tea from one company, so they dumped all of the tea in the ocean. It cost about 3 billion dollars</li>
        <li><b>The Battle of Lexington and Concord (1775)</b>: Paul Revere warned the americans that the british were coming. This battle is known as "The shot around the world"</li>
        <li><b>The Battle of Saratoga (1777)</b>: This has the famous action of George Washington crossing the Delaware River. This battle also gained the support of the french</li>
        <li><b>The Siege of Yorktown</b>: This is the final battle of the revolution, where American and French forces besiege British forces.</li>
    </ul>
