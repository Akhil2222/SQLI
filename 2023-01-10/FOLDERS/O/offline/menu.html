    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <div>
        <p>You start out with 15 seconds to move around. You want to get the clock by jumping(moving to a close circle), and moving around the circle. To jump, you click on a close circle, but you must be on the half facing the circle you are jumping to. There is a delay when you get your clock, so you must have enough time to account for the split-second delay. Each clock gives you 5 more seconds. The clocks have a longer respawn time when you obtain the clock. Your goal is to survive for the longest time possible</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>a</b>: move clockwise around the circle</li>
            <li><b>d</b>: move counterclockwise around the circle</li>
            <li><b>Click</b>: jump(can't jump diagonally)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
